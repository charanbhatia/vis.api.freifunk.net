# Visualisation of Freifunk API data

A pipeline to load data from the Freifunk API JSONs and create a GraphQL interface. Inspired by [Andi Br√§u's talk at the GPN16](https://media.ccc.de/v/gpn16-7659-die_freifunk_api).
Currently being worked on as a Google Summer of Code project.

Todo:
- [ ] Triage old issues
- [X] Set up ~~MariaDB~~ MongoDB
- [ ] Start writing the JSON to SQL processor
